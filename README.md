AddVector.hh
============

* You want to merge two vectors in cpp ?
* You want to concatenate two vectors in cpp ?
* You want to add a vector to another in cpp?

so do I. We can use AddVector.hh to do it.

AddVector.hh support :

This code is based on the snippet of [Kirill V. Lyadvinsky](http://stackoverflow.com/users/123111/kirill-v-lyadvinsky). Thanks to him !
I added template and overloading to simplify. That's all.
Hope this can help. Cheers.
